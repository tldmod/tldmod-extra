
I just uploaded some changes and wanted to post what I modified.  I figured it might
be worth having some type of text files which we can update, but its completely up to you
guys if you find this helpful or want to use it in the future, etc...

SUMMARY: playable races + sound effects, minor change to items/troops/game menu/etc

DETAILS:

- all races are coded and selectable at game start or at the "change race" on the camp menu (for testing)
- most sound effects for races are in but not all textures
- I added a modding/cheat menu to the camp menu which I find helpful while developing a mod
- I was testing Trolls in the Quick Battle 1 if you want to check them out

The following files on the SVN were modified (search for #TLD or Hokie):
  Module System = header_troops.py, module_game_menus.py, module_items.py, module_skins.py, module_sounds.py, module_troops.py
  Module Files = resource, textures, sounds folder
  Other = module.ini

Other Notes:

SOUNDS - There is a sub-folder called "unused_sounds" in the sounds folder, which was sound effects I didn't know what to do with... 
corsair_* was combined into the generic man race so I couldn't use those, I wasn't sure if stuff like evil_chant* or horn_* should be 
used for yells or victories or had another purpose, we combined the urks and urk_hai so I wasn't sure if I should use uruk_hai_* sound 
effects for that race, I didn't use any of the man_*, etc.  I'll probably need some help sorting through what is left, but if you look 
at the bottom of module_sounds.py you can see what I added and what races are missing, etc.

TEXTURES & MODELS - I wasn't able to open/export any models from stefano_ork.brf, so currently don't have an orc body/head. I did the trolls, 
but most of the rest of the races still use the regular human body and face textures.  It also takes a little while to add all the textures/models 
to a BRF file and then add them into module_skins.py, so if they are all going to be placeholders or be replaced I wasn't sure if we should bother 
adding them at this time? I also wasn't sure what hairstyles to keep for each race, what color their hair should be, what skin tone they had, etc...
I'd also need help from you guys deciding what face or body textures go with each race, since I wasn't sure where to put stuff like face_camo*, 
face_berserker*, etc.

So I'll probably need some help from you guys poking through the original TLD textures and unused sound effects, maybe sorting them into a folder for 
each race so I have a better idea of what goes with each one.  Or if textures\models\sounds are still being worked on then we might want to wait, but at 
least with this code integrated we can start using the tf_gondor type of flags for troops, etc.

Anyway, the only thing to really check out in the mod is the Quick Battle with Trolls and the new menu's on the camp menu, 
but hopefully this will at least get us started.  Let me know if there are any questions, comments, etc.
